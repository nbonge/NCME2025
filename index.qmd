 Response time has long been thought to be closely related with intelligence via processing speed. If asked to describe a genius, one might describe a person who can do complex mental calculations quickly and with ease. This stereotype that students with high ability level tend to answer questions fastest has come under question, however, with research indicating that response time is a complex process, dependent on more than just ability level. In this study, we use multilevel linear models to analyze the responses and response times on the 2019 TIMSS mathematics achievement test for eighth-grade students in the United States. Our results demonstrate response time’s dependency on student ability level, whether the student answered the item correctly (F > C phenomenon), and item difficulty in relation to the student’s ability level (distance-difficulty hypothesis). We find evidence to support the F > C phenomenon, the distance-difficulty hypothesis, and an interaction between the two. Our results affirm the complexity of cognitive processes involved in item responses, and challenge the widespread use of response time as a stand-alone metric to assess item quality and respondent effort.

## Introduction

Researchers have long contemplated the role of response time in
achievement testing, and how time-to-completion can inform about an item
functioning and participant performance. Among researchers, it is a
widely held belief that response time is indicative of the cognitive
effort required to answer an item (Höhne et al., 2007), so researchers
use response time to gauge item quality and comprehensibility (Bassili
et al., 1996; Lenzner, 2012; Lenzner et al., 2010), to detect respondent
fatigue (Nguyen, 2017), effort (Bowling et al., 2023; Krosnick, 1991;
Ulitzsch et al., 2022), and other characteristics such as persistence,
motivation, and disengagement (e.g., Nagy & Ulitzsch, 2021; Wise &
Demars, 2006). Researchers have also used response time to investigate
other cognitive processes underlying item responses (De Boeck & Jeon,
2019), with recent research challenging the long-held “faster equals
smarter” stereotype (Gernsbacher et al., 2020).

In this study, we extend previous models posed by Tancoš et al. (2023)
to achievement data, arguing that response time depends on (1) item
difficulty, (2) respondent ability level, (3) the distance between the
item’s difficulty and the respondent’s ability level (referred to as the
distance-difficulty hypothesis; Thissen, 1983), and (4) whether the
respondent answered the item correctly (F \> C phenomenon; Beckmann,
2000).

## Theoretical Framework

### The F \> C Phenomenon

One approach to modelling response time is the F \> C (False \> Correct)
phenomenon (Beckmann, 2000), also called the I \> C phenomenon, which
posits that respondents take longer to report incorrect answers than
they take to provide correct ones. Formally, the F \> C phenomenon is
given by (Beckmann, 2000, as cited in Tancoš et al., 2023, p. 3):
$$t_{ij} = \mu + \gamma FC_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij},$$ {#eq-FC} where
$t_{ij}$ is the response time of respondent $j$ on item $i$; $\mu$ is an
intercept representing the average response time across all items and
respondents; $FC_{ij}$ is a binary indicator representing whether
respondent $j$ answered item $i$ correctly; $\gamma$ is an
unstandardized regression coefficient representing the mean difference
in response time between false and correct answers; and $\epsilon_{ij}$
is a normally distributed residual.

### The Distance-Difficulty Hypothesis

Another approach to modeling response time is the distance-difficulty
hypothesis, based in item response theory, proposed originally by
Thissen (1983). The distance-difficulty hypothesis states that response
time decreases with increasing distance between an item’s difficulty
($b_i$) and a respondent's ability level ($\theta_j$), given by
$\delta_{ij} = |\theta_j-b_i|$, called person-item distance. In other
words, a respondent should take longer to answer a question that is
close to their ability level. Conversely, a respondent should take less
time to answer a question that is very easy or very difficult, relative
to the respondent’s ability level. Thissen’s model is given by:
$$\ln{(t_{ij})}=\mu+\tau_j+\beta_i-\gamma\delta_{ij}+\epsilon_{ij},$$ {#eq-DD}
where $\ln{(t_{ij})}$ is a logarithmic transformation of the response
time for respondent $j$ on item $i$ (this transformation is meant to
achieve normally distributed errors $\epsilon_{ij}$); $\mu$ is the
intercept, representing the average response time across all respondents
and items; $\tau_j$ represents respondent $j$'s average response time
across all items; $\beta_i$ represents the response time of an
average-ability respondent for item $i$; and $\gamma$ is a coefficient
representing the magnitude of the difference of the relationship between
response time and the ability-difficulty distance, which is expected to
be negative.

Ferrando and Lorenzo-Seva (2007) proposed an alternative person-item
distance measure according to the two-parameter logistic (2PL) model.
This model is given by (Ferrando & Lorenzo-Seva, 2007, p. 528):
$$\delta_{ij} = \sqrt{a_i^2 (\theta_j - b_i)^2},$$ {#eq-FLS} where $a_i$
is the discrimination for item $i$. Well-designed items have positive
discrimination, in which case, one can simplify @eq-FLS to
$\delta_{ij} = a_i|\theta_j-b_i|$. We call this discrimination-adjusted
person-item distance the "ability-difficulty distance."

### The Tancoš Models

Combining these approaches, Tancoš et al. (2023) examined the time
children took to complete fluid-reasoning tasks in a game-based
application, using item difficulty, respondent ability level, and answer
correctness as predictors in multilevel regression models with response
time as the outcome variable.

Tancoš et al. (2023) proposed two series of multilevel models relating
fluid intelligence in children to response time. The first series of
models focused on the F \> C phenomenon, controlling for item difficulty
($b_i$) and respondent ability ($\theta_j$) with an interaction between
answer correctness ($FC_{ij}$) and respondent ability. This series of
model culminates with the following model (Tancoš et al., 2023, p. 7):
$$\ln{(t_{ij})} = \mu + \nu_j +\beta_i +\gamma_1FC_{ij}+\gamma_2b_i+\gamma_3\theta_j+\gamma_{13}FC_{ij}\theta_j+\epsilon_{ij},$$ {#eq-Tancos}
where $\ln{(t_{ij})}$ is a logarithmic transformation of the response
time for person $j$ to item $i$; $\mu$ is the fixed intercept,
representing the transformed response time of an average-ability
respondent to an item of average difficulty; $\nu_j$ is the random
intercept for person $j$, representing the general speediness of
respondent $j$ (the average transformed response time of respondent $j$
across all items); $\beta_i$ is the random intercept for item $i$,
representing the expected transformed response time required by a
respondent of average ability to item $i$; $\gamma_1$, $\gamma_2$,
$\gamma_3$, and $\gamma_{13}$ are fixed effects of the corresponding
predictors; and $\epsilon_{ij}$ is the normally distributed residual.

The second series of models Tancoš et al. (2023) proposed assessed the
distance-difficulty hypothesis, and investigates the incremental
validity of the distance-difficulty hypothesis over the F \> C
phenomenon. This model is given by (Tancoš et al., 2023, p. 8):
$$\ln{(t_{ij})} = \mu + \nu_j +\beta_i +\gamma_4\delta_{ij}+\gamma_1FC_{ij}+\gamma_{14}FC_{ij}\delta_{ij}+\epsilon_{ij},$$ {#eq-Tancos2}
where $\ln{(t_{ij})}$, $\mu$, $\nu_j$, $\beta_i$, and $FC_{ij}$ are as
defined above; $\delta_{ij}=|\theta_j-b_i|$ is the absolute distance
between respondent $j$'s ability level and item $i$'s difficulty;
$\gamma_1$, $\gamma_2$, $\gamma_3$, and $\gamma_{13}$ are the fixed
effects of the corresponding predictors; and $\epsilon_{ij}$ is the
normally distributed residual.

In their study, Tancoš et al. (2023) found that the F \> C phenomenon
remained significant after controlling for item difficulty and person
ability, with a significant interaction between ability level and item
correctness. Moreover, they found ability level to be a significant
predictor of transformed response time (though, only in items with
moderate or high difficulty), while item difficulty was not. In sum,
their results indicate that on items with moderate-to-high difficulty,
children with higher ability levels took longer to report incorrect
answers than children with lower ability levels. However, Tancoš et al.
(2023) failed to find a relationship between response time and ability
level in correctly answered items, challenging the “faster equals
smarter” stereotype.

Furthermore, Tancoš et al. (2023) found incremental validity of the
distance-difficulty hypothesis above and beyond the F \> C phenomenon,
providing evidence to support that answer correctness moderates the
effect of ability-difficulty distance, ($\delta_{ij}$), on response
time. Taken together, these results suggest that items near a
respondent’s ability level take the longest amount of time to answer,
with even more time required to answer items incorrectly. Moreover, as
$\delta_{ij}$ increased the difference in response time narrowed,
eventually changing direction. That is, when an item was very easy or
very difficult relative to the respondent’s ability level, respondents
tended to take longer to report correct answers than false ones.

### The Proposed Models

In this study, we will extend the Tancoš et al. (2023) methodology to
mathematics achievement data from the 2019 TIMSS (Trends in
International Mathematics and Science Study) for fourth- and
eighth-grade students. Using these data, we will compare results from
two series of multilevel linear models to assess the F \> C phenomenon,
the distance-difficulty hypothesis, and any interaction between the two.

The first series of models will assess the F \> C phenomenon,
controlling for ability level and item difficulty. With these models, we
will determine whether the relationship between ability level and
response time is moderated by answer correctness. Then, we will assess
the distance-difficulty hypothesis using the second series of models,
controlling for the discrimination-adjusted ability-difficulty distance.
If we find the F \> C phenomenon and distance-difficulty hypothesis both
hold, we will investigate whether there is a significant interaction
between the (discrimination-adjusted) ability-difficulty distance, which
we call “the Tancoš model.” A significant interaction would suggest a
difference in the relationship between the time needed to answer an item
and the ability-difficulty distance, according to whether the respondent
answered the item correctly. See Appendix 1 for the list of models used.

## Method {#sec-method}

### Participants and Measures

We examined data from the 2019 TIMSS mathematics achievement assessment.
The TIMSS is a set of international assessments of fourth- and
eighth-grade students’ mathematics and science achievement and
attitudes, along with survey responses from teachers and principals to
gather information related to the background contexts for learning. The
TIMSS is conducted every four years, with 64 countries participating in
the 2019 assessment cycle (Mullis et al., 2020). In the United States,
data were collected from 9,944 eighth-grade students in 273 schools.
Beginning in 2019, the United States opted into the eTIMSS, a new
computer-based version of the assessment, allowing response time data to
be collected alongside participating student responses. Students
answered items from one of fourteen booklets, composed of item block
combinations. Response times were computed as time in seconds spent on a
page with a single item, or a set of connected items (such as multi-part
questions); to maximize the validity of our response time records, we
dropped items that were presented as a set on a page and kept only those
items that were presented in isolation on a page. We call these
“isolated items.” After dropping items presented together on a page, we
analyzed responses from each booklet to determine which booklet(s) had
the most isolated items and the most responses per booklet. A list of
each booklet’s number of isolated items and number of respondents for
eighth grade students are shown in Appendix 2. Of the 14 booklets, we
chose Booklet 14. Our final sample contained 552 complete responses to
13 isolated items.

### IRT Analysis

All analyses were conducted using R Statistical Software (v4.4.1; R Core
Team, 2024). The TIMSS mathematics assessments were validated by the
creators using a two-parameter logistic (2PL) model, so we performed a
2PL IRT analysis using the *mirt* R package (v1.41; Chalmers, 2012) to
obtain each item’s difficulty ($b_i$), discrimination ($a_i$), and each
respondent’s estimated ability parameter ($θ_j$). See @tbl-Table1 for
descriptive statistics and 2PL parameters. Empirical reliability was
sufficiently high for analysis ($r_{xx} = .85$).

### Main Analysis

Our main analysis involved two series of nested linear multilevel
regression models. The first series of models tested the F \> C
phenomenon, controlling for item difficulty and respondent ability; the
second series of models assessed the distance-difficulty hypothesis and
its interaction with the F \> C phenomenon. We used the *lme4* package
(v1.1-35.5; Bates et al., 2015) to estimate each model, and after
estimation, we computed the variance inflation factor (VIF) to check
each model for multicollinearity using the *car* package (v3.1-3; Fox &
Weisberg, 2019). Finally, we used the *lmerTest* package (v3.1-3;
Kuznetsova et al., 2017) to compare models.

We began our analysis by estimating a null model (Model 0) to serve as a
baseline for both series of models. Consistent with Tancoš et al.
(2023), Model 0 included only fixed and random intercept terms for
respondents and items; all models used a logarithmically transformed
response time for the dependent variable to linearize the relationship
between the predictor variables and response time.

For the first series of models, we began by defining Model A1, which
includes only a binary predictor for item correctness ($FC_{ij}$); Model
A2 includes two additional predictors, item difficulty $b_i$ and
respondent ability $\theta_j$ for control variables; finally, Model A3
includes an interaction term between item correctness and respondent
ability to investigate whether item correctness moderates the
relationship between ability level and the F \> C phenomenon. Model A3
is given by @eq-Tancos.

The second series of models begins with Model B1, which includes only
the discrimination-adjusted ability-difficulty distance,
$\delta_{ij}=a_i |\theta_j-b_i|$ (“ability-difficulty distance”) to
test the distance-difficulty hypothesis. Model B2 includes $FC_{ij}$,
representing item correctness, to assess the incremental validity of the
F \> C phenomenon beyond the distance-difficulty hypothesis. Finally,
Model B3, given by @eq-Tancos2, includes an interaction term between the
ability-difficulty distance $\delta_{ij}$ and item correctness $FC_{ij}$
to investigate whether the distance-difficulty hypothesis is moderated
by item correctness.

## Results
### Null Model

The null model, Model 0, served as our baseline model for both series of
models. The fixed intercept was significant, ($μ=$ 3.92, 95% CI \[3.67,
4.18\]). Transforming this parameter, we see the average response time
for a student of average ability on an item of average difficulty was
54.16 seconds. @tbl-Table2 displays complete results for Model 0.

### Models Assessing F \> C Phenomenon

We began with Model A1. We found it took students significantly more
time to answer an item correctly than it did to answer incorrectly
($γ_1=$ 0.21, 95% CI \[0.17, 0.25\]). Transforming this parameter, we
see students took on average, 1.23 seconds longer to provide correct
responses than incorrect ones. @tbl-Table3 displays complete results for
Model A1.

In Model A2, the F \> C phenomenon was suppressed but remained
significant, ($γ_1=$ 0.18, 95% CI \[0.14, 0.22\]). Students with higher
ability levels took significantly longer to answer items ($γ_3=$ 0.13,
95% CI \[0.09, 0.17\]), and students took significantly longer to answer
more difficult questions ($γ_2=$ 0.36, 95% CI \[0.08, 0.62\]).
@tbl-Table4 displays complete results for Model A2.

In Model A3, the F \> C phenomenon remained significant ($γ_1=$ 0.19,
95% CI \[0.15, 0.23\]), as did item difficulty ($γ_2=$ 0.35, 95% CI
\[0.07, 0.62\]) and student ability level ($γ_3=$ 0.22, 95% CI \[0.18,
0.27\]). Moreover, we found a significant interaction between item
correctness and ability level ($γ_{13}=$-0.21, 95% CI \[-0.26, -0.16\]).
Taken together, we can interpret this to mean that students with lower
ability levels took longer to answer items correctly than incorrectly,
and students with higher ability levels took longer to provide incorrect
answers than correct ones. Moreover, we found a positive relationship
between ability level and response time for incorrect answers, but no
substantial relationship between ability level and response time for
correct answers. This pattern is shown in @fig-Figure1, and @tbl-Table5
displays complete results for Model A3.

Overall, every model fit better than the null model, and each model fit
better than the preceding model in the series @tbl-Table6. Given the
information criteria and the goodness-of-fit measures, we chose to
retain Model A3 as our final model.

### Models Assessing the Distance-Difficulty Hypothesis

Model B1 assessed the distance-difficulty hypothesis as a predictor for
the logarithmic transform of response time, which was significant
($γ_4=$ -0.09, 95% CI \[-0.10, -0.08\]). From this, we see that for each
one-unit increase in $δ_{ij}$, response time is decreased by 8.6%. For
example, when $δ_{ij}=0$, the expected response time is 60.46 seconds;
when $δ_{ij}=1$, the expected response time is 55.26 seconds; when
$δ_{ij}=2$, the expected response time is 50.50 seconds, and so on.
@tbl-Table7 displays the complete results for Model B1.

For Model B2, we added item correctness as a fixed effect, which was
significant ($γ_1=$ 0.22, 95% CI \[0.18, 0.26\]). The ability-difficulty
distance remained significant but was suppressed ($γ_4=$ -0.09, 95% CI
\[-0.11, -0.08\]). From this, we see that students took longer to
provide correct answers than incorrect ones, and regardless of item
correctness, as the ability-difficulty distance increased, response time
decreased. See @tbl-Table8 for complete results for Model B2.

Finally, in Model B3, we added an interaction term between item
correctness and the ability-difficulty distance, which was significant
($γ_{14}=$ -0.08, 95% CI \[-0.11, -0.05\]). Item correctness and
ability-difficulty distance remained significant ($γ_1=$ -0.07, 95% CI
\[-0.08,-0.05\] and $γ_4=$ 0.29, 95% CI \[0.24,0.34\], respectively).
Taken together, we interpret these results as follows: students take
longer to provide correct answers to items near their ability level. As
the ability-difficulty distance increases, the relationship switches
around $δ_{ij}=$ 3.8, such that students beyond this point take longer
to provide incorrect answers. So, students take longer to provide
incorrect answers to items that are very difficult or very easy relative
to their ability level. Moreover, response time decreases as the
ability-difficulty distance increases, regardless of item correctness;
that is, students respond quicker to items that are very difficult or
very easy relative to their ability level. This pattern is shown in
@fig-Figure2, and @tbl-Table9 displays complete results for Model B3.

Overall, each model fit the data better than the null model, and every
model in the series fit the data better than the preceding model
(@tbl-Table10). Per this evidence, along with information criteria for
each model, we chose to retain Model B3 as our final model.

## Conclusion

The results of our study show that eighth-grade students’ responses to a
mathematics achievement assessment support the F \> C phenomenon after
controlling for ability level, item difficulty, and item correctness.
Moreover, students' responses provide evidence to support the
distance-difficulty hypothesis after controlling for ability-difficulty
distance and item correctness, with a significant interaction between
item correctness and the ability-difficulty distance.

The interaction between the F \> C phenomenon and item correctness may
have several explanations. Students with higher ability levels may have
higher levels of grit and may be more likely to try multiple approaches
to a problem if their initial strategy/approach does not yield a
solution (Credé et al., 2017; Duckworth et al., 2007; Steinmayr et al.,
2018). In contrast, students with lower ability levels may not see a
clear path to a solution when beginning a problem. As we saw,
lower-ability students took longer to answer questions correctly, which
could be indicative of students pausing to develop a plan of attack
before answering the question. Researchers (e.g., Chan et al., 2022)
have found that longer pauses before beginning a problem can lead to
more efficient problem-solving, and, ultimately, faster response times.

The observed patterns in the relationship between the ability-difficulty
distance and response time align with the findings from the Tancoš et
al. (2023) study; students took longest to answer questions that matched
the student’s ability level, and response time decreased as the
ability-difficulty distance increased. One possible explanation for the
extended time taken to answer questions that match a student's ability
level is that the question may be difficult enough to be challenging,
but not so challenging that they have little chance of answering the
question correctly. When items are very easy relative to a student’s
ability level, this pattern seems intuitive: easier items take less
time. However, the idea that students take less time to answer very
difficult questions is less intuitive but may be a result of an initial
misjudgment of the item’s difficulty, which would explain our finding
that students took longer to answer very difficult questions
incorrectly.

Our study is limited by the low-stakes nature of the TIMSS mathematics
assessments. Students may not have been highly motivated to perform well
in this achievement assessment, particularly toward the end of the test,
so our estimates of student ability and item difficulty may be biased by
a lack of sufficient effort. Moreover, the magnitude of errors may be
compounded by the initial IRT estimate and subsequent multilevel
regression model. Finally, there may be unanalyzed differences in the
observed relationships across students of different demographic groups
(such as gender, race/ethnicity, or socio-economic status). Future
research could examine the magnitude of the fixed effects we analyzed in
this study by demographic group. Future research may also explore
whether the results from this study hold with attitudinal scales or
achievement scales in other academic disciplines. This study extended
the response time models found by Tancoš et al. (2023) in a
fluid-reasoning task to a mathematics achievement assessment involving
crystallized intelligence. Researchers and educators alike utilize
response time as a catch-all measurement of item suitability, respondent
effort, and ability-level, but this study’s results imply response time
is not appropriate as a stand-alone diagnostic tool, as response time is
influenced by a variety of factors.
