If asked to describe a genius, one might describe a person who can do complex mental calculations quickly and with ease. This stereotype that students with high ability level tend to answer questions fastest has come under question, however, with research indicating that response time is a complex process, dependent on more than just ability level. In this study, we use multilevel linear models to analyze the responses and response times on the 2019 TIMSS mathematics achievement test for eighth-grade students in the United States. Our results demonstrate response time’s dependency on student ability level, whether the student answered the item correctly (F > C phenomenon), and item difficulty in relation to the student’s ability level (distance-difficulty hypothesis). We find evidence to support the F > C phenomenon, the distance-difficulty hypothesis, and an interaction between the two. Our results affirm the complexity of cognitive processes involved in item responses, and challenge the widespread use of response time as a stand-alone metric to assess item quality and respondent effort.  \ndate: 04/25/2025\npublished-title: \"Presentation Date\"\nbibliography: references.bib\nnumber-sections: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\neruptions <- c(1492, 1585, 1646, 1677, 1712, 1949, 1971, 2021)\nn_eruptions <- length(eruptions)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {#cell-fig-timeline .cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\npar(mar = c(3, 1, 1, 1) + 0.1)\nplot(eruptions, rep(0, n_eruptions), \n  pch = \"|\", axes = FALSE)\naxis(1)\nbox()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Timeline of recent earthquakes on La Palma](index_files/figure-html/fig-timeline-1.png){#fig-timeline fig-alt='An event plot of the years of the last 8 eruptions on La Palma.' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\navg_years_between_eruptions <- mean(diff(eruptions[-n_eruptions]))\navg_years_between_eruptions\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout .hidden}\n\n```\n[1] 79.83333\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on data up to and including 1971, eruptions on La Palma happen every 79.8 years on average.\n\nStudies of the magma systems feeding the volcano, such as @marrero2019, have proposed that there are two main magma reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano; one in the mantle (30-40km depth) which charges and in turn feeds a shallower crustal reservoir (10-20km depth).\n\nEight eruptions have been recorded since the late 1400s (@fig-timeline).\n\nData and methods are discussed in @sec-data-methods.\n\nLet $x$ denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then, $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution\n\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^{x}}{x !}\n$$ {#eq-poisson}\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the rate of eruptions per year. Using @eq-poisson, the probability of an eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated.\n\n| Name                 | Year   |\n| -------------------- | ------ |\n| Current              | 2021   |\n| Teneguía             | 1971   |\n| Nambroque            | 1949   |\n| El Charco            | 1712   |\n| Volcán San Antonio   | 1677   |\n| Volcán San Martin    | 1646   |\n| Tajuya near El Paso  | 1585   |\n| Montaña Quemada      | 1492   |\n\n: Recent historic eruptions on La Palma {#tbl-history}\n\n@tbl-history summarises the eruptions recorded since the colonization of the islands by Europeans in the late 1400s.\n\n![Map of La Palma](images/la-palma-map.png){#fig-map}\n\nLa Palma is one of the west most islands in the Volcanic Archipelago of the Canary Islands (@fig-map). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< embed notebooks/explore-earthquakes.qmd#fig-spatial-plot >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@fig-spatial-plot shows the location of recent Earthquakes on La Palma.\n\n## Data & Methods {#sec-data-methods}\n\n## Conclusion\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n:::{#refs}\n\n:::",
